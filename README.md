Docker &amp; Container

Here, we have created a YAML file(docker-compose.yml) where we have defined the volumes that the containers will use, and are communicating with the help of docker compose.
So, in this YAML file we have defined the configurations of the client and server services.
We will run it with the help of $ docker compose up command. This command is used to build, create, start, and attach containers for a service and aggregates their output.
